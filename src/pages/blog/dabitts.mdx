# Tracking Habits

Every individual has their own unique way of staying organized and managing daily tasks. Whether it's a digital tool like Jira or Apple Notes, or a more traditional method like pen and paper, people rely on various tools to keep track of their to-do lists. However, despite the numerous options available, I always found myself wanting a solution that was tailored to my specific needs and preferences.

That's why I created [Dabitts](https://www.dabitts.com/) - an opinionated habit tracking app that allows me to stay on top of my daily tasks exactly the way I like it.

# My Opinionated Opinions

Dabitts was designed with my personal task management preferences in mind, but I believe that they can be useful for others as well. To help users maintain an organized and manageable task list, I've implemented several limitations that are based on my own opinions.

1. Tasks can only be created for the current day or the day after to avoid an overwhelming backlog of tasks.

2. Any unfinished tasks will roll over to the next day.

3. Tasks must be assigned to a specific category or "bucket" that the user creates, such as Work, Personal, or Hobby. This makes it easier to quickly filter and find tasks by category.

4. Users must assign a time estimate to each task, which can be selected from a preset list of durations (15 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, or 4 hours). This helps to prevent overcommitment and provides a clearer sense of how much time is needed to complete all tasks.

5. Tasks cannot exceed 140 characters and should be kept short and descriptive.

6. When appropriate, users can add related materials such as documentation or specific repositories to each task.

Overall, these opinionated features were implemented to help users focus on what they need to do each day and manage their workload effectively.
