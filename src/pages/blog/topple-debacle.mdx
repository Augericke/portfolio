# Another Daily Word Game

I’ve always been a bit obsessed with word games. Whether it's crossword puzzles, Scrabble, Boggle, or whatever else I’ve downloaded on my phone at the moment. There is just something about coming up with words from a random selection of letters and the satisfaction of fitting them together like puzzle pieces that I can’t resist.

So, in that same spirit, I thought it would be fun to build my own little daily word puzzle game: [Topple Debacle](https://topple-debacle.vercel.app/).

# The Rules

The aim of the game is to eliminate all the squares on the board by constructing words from connected letters in any direction. However, to be successful, players must pay close attention to their word choices and the order in which they are played, as each square must be used exactly twice.

Adding to the challenge, words must be at least three letters long, and any space where a word can be formed will be filled upon the player's guess. This means that even a seemingly small word can have a significant impact on the overall outcome of the game.

# Acknowledgement

There is a fair bit of information online about the approaches used to parse a grid of characters for words (or as I have deemed the Boggle problem). However, I would like to give credit to Niall Connaughton’s [“Solving Boggle Boards At Scale”](https://blog.niallconnaughton.com/2015/12/10/solving-boggle-boards-at-scale/) for pointing me in the right direction.

Also I just wanted to say I had a blast building this little addition to the already vast world of online word games. Trying to design a game that balances accessibility with a high level of difficulty was a challenging but rewarding experience (especially considering that I now play Topple Debacle daily).
